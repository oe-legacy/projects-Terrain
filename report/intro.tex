\section{Extensions}
% Antager opengl 2.1 som core s√• brugte extensions

Since every new version of OpenGL is composed of a set of extension,
OpenGL now consists of quite a large number of extensions. Therefore
instead of listing every extension we're using, which would be quite a
long list, we will instead assume OpenGL 2.1 and only list extensions
not in this version.

\subsection{GL\_EXT\_texture\_array}


\subsection{GL\_ARB\_framebuffer\_object}

FrameBuffers allow programmers to render colors or depth directly to
textures, instead of rendering to the backbuffer and then performing
an expensive copy to texture. This is useful when creating post
processing effects such as depth of field or motion blur, since the
effect is a shader applied to the rendered image.

% OE implementation

To facilitate easy setup of frame buffer objects, we have created the
FrameBuffer abstraction in OpenEngine


% own dimensions if the programmer wants higher quality images to
% apply the effect to.
