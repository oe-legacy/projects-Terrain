\section{Setting the scene}
As when directing a movie or play, the director writes a script, and
sets the scene which sets the mood and describes the place for where
the play / action will unroll.

The following report decribes techniques for ..., where we, the
authors had the following particular setting in mind.

The main scene consists of a island surrounded by ocean as far as the
eye can tell, the island has sandy beaches, grass fields, and mountains
with snow on the top.

This we had allready implemented before the course started. The island
was implemented as a height map, where the ocean was plane seperating
the terrain into and underwater environment and land. The
differantiation of sandy beach, grass fields, rocks, and snow was
based on height and rendered by interpolating different textures for
each type.

\section{Rendering outdoor scenes}
To create a more convincing and realistic outdoor scenery we needed to
add more details than the main ... described by section \ref{}.

The first addition to the above, is to introduce controlable
procedural content.

To convince the audience ... we will introduce motion by animated
clouds, rising and setting sun, waving grass...


Furthermore, we wish to scenery to look astonishing



\section{OpenGL version and extensions}
% Antager opengl 2.1 som core s√• brugte extensions

Since every new version of OpenGL is composed of a set of extension,
OpenGL now consists of quite a large number of extensions. Therefore
instead of listing every extension we're using, which would be quite a
long list, we will instead assume OpenGL 2.1 and only list extensions
not in this version.

\subsection{GL\_EXT\_texture\_array}


\subsection{GL\_ARB\_framebuffer\_object}

FrameBuffers allow programmers to render colors or depth directly to
textures, instead of rendering to the backbuffer and then performing
an expensive copy to texture. This is useful when creating post
processing effects such as depth of field or motion blur, since the
effect is a shader applied to the rendered image.

% OE implementation

To facilitate easy setup of frame buffer objects, we have created the
FrameBuffer abstraction in OpenEngine


% own dimensions if the programmer wants higher quality images to
% apply the effect to.
