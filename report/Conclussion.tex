%Post Process

%% Storing and rebinding the previous framebuffer means that we can chain
%% several post process nodes together to form complex effects or
%% minimize the cost of applying an effect by using for example separable
%% convolution.

% One/two fbos pr node is a waste but makes it easy to setup and they
% can be configured individually

% Other effects have been implemented, like wobble, edge detection,
% pixelate and an underwater that combines...



\section{Future work}

An extension to the atmospheric dome is to include the location or
angle of the sun to make a more beautiful sunrise and sunset.

Clip mapping, will make it easy to use LOD shaders (out with bump
and specular) Also simply geometry LOD using alpha blending (take
care to render geometry in the correct order)

Next step for the PPnode is merge

dof flicker
