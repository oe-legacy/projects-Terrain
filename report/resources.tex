\chapter{Resources}

Our project makes use of a lot of textures. These textures have been
obtained in several places and here we would like to give credit for
them where credit is due.

The following textures have been created using
FilterForge\footnote{www.filterforge.com}: \class{dirt.tga},
\class{dirtNormals.tga}, \class{newGrass.tga},
\class{newGrassNormals.tga}, \class{rockface.jpg},
\class{rockfaceBump.jpg}.

\class{EarthClearSky2.png} was borrowed from the open source framework
Caelum.

\class{waterDistortion.jpg} and \class{waterNormalmap.jpg} where both
found at Michael Horsh blog,
http://www.bonzaisoftware.com/water\_tut.html

\class{grassStraw.tga} is part of the free version of Unity3D.

\class{sand-old.jpg}, \class{sandNormals-old.jpg} and \class{snow.tga}
where all found on Psionic's 3D Game
Resources\footnote{http://www.psionic3d.co.uk}.

The clouds, stars and snow normalmap have all been generated by us.
