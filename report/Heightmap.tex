\chapter{Heightmap}

\section{Level of detail}

% Patches, easy to understand and implement. 
% Seams
% Alternative is mipmapping

% Geomorphing

% A few easy instructions in the vertex shader for the vertex. But
% doesn't scale well

% Alternative is alpha blending, scales nicely but could transparency
% is non triviel.


\section{Vertex shader}

% Geomorphing, fordele/ulemper, alternativer

% Terrain skal placeres i worldspace, acceptabel antagelse og spare os
% for matrix multiplicationer.

\section{Fragment shader}

% Light calculations (blinn/phong)

% Calculating the appropriate texture index and blending with the next
% layer.

% Normals and tangent space

% Bump mapping (rotating the normal in tangent space)

% Optimized texture lookup (saving 2 normals in 4 channels and
% blending them)

% Parallax, parallaxocclusion?
